pass data from 1 component to another in react js
there are 3 ways to pass data from 1 component to another in react js

1. props
2. context
3. redux

1. props
  props is the simplest way to pass data from 1 component to another in react js
  props is a special keyword in react js which stands for properties
  every component in react js has a props object
  props object contains all the properties passed to the component
  props are read only / immutable


drawbacks of props
  1. props are read only
  2. props can only pass data from parent to child component
  3. if we have to pass data from child to parent component, we have to use callback functions

  props drilling
  app --> content --> subContnet *

  virtual dom

react js creaete clone of original dom calls it virtual dom
virtl dom is a lightweight copy of original dom
virtaul dom have state of original dom

if we make any changes in virtual dom, react js will compare virtual dom with original dom

hook: react built in functions
useState : it use to create state in functional component


app --> users [array {id,name age}] -->child -->userList --> props.users.map

index.js
<BrowserRouter>
